## Hi, I'm Sunil! 👋

### 🧑‍💻 About Me
- I'm really interested in how the behind-the-scenes stuff of websites and apps works (that's backend development!).
- I enjoy figuring things out and making repetitive tasks automatic.
- Fun fact: I can solve a 10x10 Rubik's cube!
- My birthday is in October. 🎃
